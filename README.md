# About the Project

I wanna talk about my just finished mini project of building an website for an Electrical Store headed as the title "KAVYA ELECTRICAL STORE". This website will let people in the city know about their services, availability of components online and and also put any query through the contact query form. Google Map iframe is attached as well, so that one can reach us with very ease.

There is a lot of feature i am about to add to the website likewise :
User Authentication System : One can logon & get the cart ready for them.
Filter Management Tool : Users can filter while choosing the right product by filtering the brand name, sort prices & stuffs.
Chat Machine : One can find the solutions for frequent problems, and if unsolved will be forwarded to the admin right away.
Review Count : That will let them improve their services.

I can't thought of any more features to add as such of now, if you can. Do let me know. Also i deployed this project in so much of hurry as the Store Head wants it live as soon as i could. It took me 10 full days from write the first line of code<html> to signing the SSL certification. Must say it gives you more happiness when you're making something for the very first time.

Caught up with few bugs during the deployment process , as it was a totally new environment, fixed a few on my own, learnt about some from the communities over the internet - DigitalOcean Community , StackOverflow, GitHub.

𝗧𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗻𝗼𝗹𝗼𝗴𝗶𝗲𝘀 𝗨𝘀𝗲𝗱 : HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, PYTHON, DJANGO, Ubuntu VPS, Domain from GoDaddy, Nameservers by DigitalOcean, Apache Web Server, FileZilla - for creating SFTP connection, Let's Encrypt - Certbot.

We have a full secure connection to our website www.kavyaelectricalstore.co.in as if you gonna to create an unsecured connection through http protocol, it will redirect you to https://www.kavyaelectricalstore.co.in . A secure connection prevent your sensitive information from being breached.

Thank You
